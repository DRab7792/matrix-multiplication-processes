This program was written by Dan Rabinowitz, and can be treated as an open source program.

This program was was created to implement a matrix multiplication using a new process for each step of the dot product multiplication. This is made possible by using shared memory in the heap. This program does not come with a Makefile but can be compiled on its own using g++. The text file containing the two matrices should follow this format:

4 5 6
1 2 3
******
1 2
3 4
5 6
